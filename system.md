# About SATIM

## Who is SATIM?

SATIM (Société d'Automatisation des Transactions Interbancaires et de Monétique) is a company founded in 1995 by the banking community in Algeria. It operates as the interbank payment processor for domestic and international cards and is a subsidiary of seven Algerian banks and an insurance institution.

Its main role is to support the development and modernization of banking services, particularly promoting card payment methods. SATIM collaborates with 18 members in its interbank network, which includes 17 banks (both public and private) and Algeria Post.

In recent years, SATIM has experienced significant growth, with over 1,351 ATMs and 40,000 electronic payment terminals connected to its servers, as well as 274 operational e-commerce websites on its platform. The increase in usage of the CIB card has notably influenced Algerians' purchasing habits.


## What does SATIM do?

SATIM acts as the central processing hub for electronic banking transactions. It connects the cardholder's bank (CIB or EDDAHABIA) with the bank of the merchant or ATM.

Think of SATIM as the invisible bridge that allows money to flow securely between those banks when a transaction occurs. It receives the transaction request, verifies if the cardholder has enough funds, and then authorizes (or declines) the transaction.

Basically, SATIM ensures that every card payment or ATM withdrawal happens securely and reliably in the background. It's what makes it possible for you to pay with your card at a store or withdraw money from an ATM, even if your bank and the merchant's bank are different.

# Understanding CIB and Payment Processes

## What is a CIB card? 
The CIB card is an Algerian interbank debit card, recognizable by the CIB logo, signifying its acceptance across multiple banks within the country. Equipped with a microchip for security, this card allows holders to make purchases at various merchants like hotels, supermarkets, restaurants, and pharmacies. It also enables cash withdrawals from ATMs (DABs) throughout Algeria. The CIB card is offered in two primary types: Classic and Gold. Both provide standard payment and withdrawal functionalities, however, the Gold card differentiates itself by offering higher transaction limits and additional unspecified features. Fundamentally, the CIB card serves as a widely accepted means of conducting secure and convenient transactions within Algeria's financial network.

## Card Payment Process:
**1. Card Insertion: The cardholder inserts their card into the terminal (ATM or EFTPOS).**
**2. PIN Entry: The cardholder enters their PIN to validate the transaction.**
**3. Authorization Request: A request for authorization is sent to the card issuer.**
**4. Authorization Response: The issuer either approves or declines the transaction.**
**5. Transaction Capture: The merchant's bank (acquirer) captures the transaction details.**
**6. Clearing and Settlement: The acquirer presents the transaction for clearing and settlement.**
**7. Funds Transfer: The cardholder's account is debited, and the merchant's account is credited.**

## Online Payment:
The development of e-payment in Algeria is a primary objective for SATIM. As a pioneer and the entity responsible for technically certifying e-commerce websites, SATIM is dedicated to supporting businesses in implementing online payment solutions.

Authorized since the signing of the E-commerce Law in November 2018, online payments were initially available only to major billers. Today, this service is accessible to all businesses wishing to integrate it, provided they obtain authorization from the GIE Monétique.

This authorization, allowing for the integration of the e-payment module, is only granted after a process initiated by the acquiring bank that signed the online sales contract with the merchant. After obtaining preliminary approval from relevant authorities, the merchant must seek technical certification from SATIM. This certification is granted only if the merchant's website meets all the technical requirements for proper operation.

With the rise of digitalization and communication technologies, the widespread adoption of online payments in Algeria is imminent. This explains the growth observed since SATIM launched its e-payment platform in 2016.

SATIM provides a secure and straightforward online payment solution for making and receiving payments. Their service allows businesses to accept CIB card payments online, offering customers a worry-free shopping experience with secure and hassle-free transactions.

### Advantages of Online Payment:
- Payment guarantee for merchants.
- Global market reach for businesses and individuals.
- Improved checkout flow.
- Increased sales.
- Simplified sales management and accounting.
- Elimination of counterfeit money risks.
- Reduced need to carry cash.
- Enhanced security: lost or stolen cards are unusable without the PIN.

## ATM/Cash Machine Withdrawal Operations:

ATMs and cash machines integrated into the interbank network allow CIB cardholders to withdraw cash and check their account balances 24/7. These machines offer ease of use and complete transaction security through the EMV standard.

## Point-of-Sale Payment Operations:

SATIM, in partnership with banks, offers merchants a proximity payment solution through the CIB card. This solution allows for accepting financial transactions on Electronic Payment Terminals (EPTs), ensuring secure transactions through the EMV standard. It also enhances safety for both merchants and customers by utilizing a confidential PIN, reducing risks associated with theft, assault, and counterfeit money.
The collected funds are directly and automatically deposited into the merchant's account with very short crediting times.


## Approval Process

SATIM, authorized by GIE Monétique, operates in interbank payment activities in accordance with technical and functional standards and procedures.
The various areas of approval handled by SATIM are:

- Pre-certification of ATMs (DAB/GAB)
- Pre-certification of Electronic Payment Terminals (EPT)
- Pre-certification of online merchants
- Pre-certification of interbank electronic payment switches
- Pre-certification of cards (CIB)

# Security and Compliance

## 3D Secure Protocol:
3D Secure is a security protocol designed to provide a high level of security for online transactions. It verifies the cardholder's identity with their bank, aiming to protect merchants from fraudulent activity.

## Fraud Management:

Payment security and prevention are key success factors for E-commerce. SATIM allows you to manage, control, and minimize the risk of transaction fraud in both E-commerce and distance selling by combining cardholder authentication with blocking rules and filters.

Fraud prevention is a priority for us, which is why we understand that we must constantly strive to offer the best anti-fraud solutions.

### Fraud Prevention Methods:
- CVC verification
- Address verification
- IP geolocation
- Blacklists
- 3D Secure (Verified by MasterCard Secure Code)

## Compliance:

CIB SATIM cards are equipped with Europay Mastercard Visa standards, abbreviated as EMV, the international security standard for payment cards (smart cards).
