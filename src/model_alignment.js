const whoIsSatim = `
SATIM (Société d'Automatisation des Transactions Interbancaires et de Monétique) is a company founded in 1995 by the banking community in Algeria. It operates as the interbank payment processor for domestic and international cards and is a subsidiary of seven Algerian banks and an insurance institution.

Its main role is to support the development and modernization of banking services, particularly promoting card payment methods. SATIM collaborates with 18 members in its interbank network, which includes 17 banks (both public and private) and Algeria Post.

In recent years, SATIM has experienced significant growth, with over 1,351 ATMs and 40,000 electronic payment terminals connected to its servers, as well as 274 operational e-commerce websites on its platform. The increase in usage of the CIB card has notably influenced Algerians' purchasing habits.
`;

const whatSatimDoes = `
SATIM acts as the central processing hub for electronic banking transactions. It connects the cardholder's bank (CIB or EDDAHABIA) with the bank of the merchant or ATM.

Think of SATIM as the invisible bridge that allows money to flow securely between those banks when a transaction occurs. It receives the transaction request, verifies if the cardholder has enough funds, and then authorizes (or declines) the transaction.

Basically, SATIM ensures that every card payment or ATM withdrawal happens securely and reliably in the background. It's what makes it possible for you to pay with your card at a store or withdraw money from an ATM, even if your bank and the merchant's bank are different.

const onlinePayment = `The development of e-payment in Algeria is a primary objective for SATIM. As a pioneer and the entity responsible for technically certifying e-commerce websites, SATIM is dedicated to supporting businesses in implementing online payment solutions.

Authorized since the signing of the E-commerce Law in November 2018, online payments were initially available only to major billers. Today, this service is accessible to all businesses wishing to integrate it, provided they obtain authorization from the GIE Monétique.

This authorization, allowing for the integration of the e-payment module, is only granted after a process initiated by the acquiring bank that signed the online sales contract with the merchant. After obtaining preliminary approval from relevant authorities, the merchant must seek technical certification from SATIM. This certification is granted only if the merchant's website meets all the technical requirements for proper operation.

With the rise of digitalization and communication technologies, the widespread adoption of online payments in Algeria is imminent. This explains the growth observed since SATIM launched its e-payment platform in 2016.

SATIM provides a secure and straightforward online payment solution for making and receiving payments. Their service allows businesses to accept CIB card payments online, offering customers a worry-free shopping experience with secure and hassle-free transactions.`;
